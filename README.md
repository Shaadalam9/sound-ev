## Setup
Tested with Python 3.9.11. To setup the environment run these two commands in a parent folder of the downloaded repository (replace `/` with `\` and possibly add `--user` if on Windows:

**Step 1:**  

Clone the repository
```command line
git clone https://github.com/bazilinskyy/multiped.git
```

**Step 2:** 

Install Dependencies
```command line
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Step 3:**

Ensure you have the required datasets in the data/ directory.

**Step 4:**

Run the code:
```command line
python3 analysis.py
```

## Troubleshooting
### Troubleshooting setup
#### ERROR: multiped is not a valid editable requirement
Check that you are indeed in the parent folder for running command `pip install -e multiped`. This command will not work from inside of the folder containing the repo.
