Clone the repository
```command line
git clone https://github.com/Shaadalam9/sound-ev
```

**Step 2:** 

Install Dependencies
```command line
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Step 3:**

Ensure you have the required datasets in the data/ directory.

**Step 4:**

Run the code:
```command line
python3 analysis.py
